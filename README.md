Work Day Scheduler

# work-day-schedulerr

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN it displays time slots for that day
WHEN I scroll down
THEN the page displays several timeslots to enter events into
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN the individual can type what they may need to do for that day
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN the user can type what they want
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN it saves that event for the user to look at in the future (not working)
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events stay in the scheduler (not working)
